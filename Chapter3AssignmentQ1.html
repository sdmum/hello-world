    Hello, my name is Shawn Daudi. I was born and raised in Southern California and am the youngest of four siblings.
    I am twenty five years old, and have been living in Fairfield, Iowa for six years. I received a bachelor's of business
    administration in 2017 from Maharishi University of Management and currently work part time at MUM.

    <p>
    I have always been fascinated by technology and would like to be a part of the new wave of technological advancement.
    I enjoy 3D printing and modeling, and would like to further my technical proficiency by learning how to program. My ultimate goal 
    is to incorporate programming with hardware engineering to be able to find a career in the industrial robotics field.
