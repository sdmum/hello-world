    <h1>China Buffet</h1>
    <p>
    I have always liked the idea of owning and operating a Chinese buffet. The location of my buffet would ideally be 
    be within a mall or town center. I know many friends that have shared the same dream and are very good cooks in Chinese cuisine.

    </p>
    <p>
    My Chinese buffet will be named Imperial Buffet and would include all you can eat meals priced at ten dollars.
    There would be a wide selection of different foods including noodles, orange chicken and smoked salmon. Children 
    would eat free!
